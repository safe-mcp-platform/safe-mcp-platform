  "tactic": "Discovery",
  "description": "Tool enumeration is a reconnaissance technique where an adversary attempts to identify which tools, services, plugins, connectors, or helper components exist in a target environment—including their versions and configurations. The goal is to understand the capabilities exposed by the environment (e.g., code execution helpers, file access APIs, external connectors) to identify potential follow-on attack opportunities such as misconfigured services, unpatched versions, or weak authentication.  \n\n---",
  "examples": [
    "An attacker with a stolen developer API key quietly probes an MCP, enumerates available tools (storage, external fetch, job runner), and uses them in low-noise steps to steal credentials and exfiltrate sensitive data. This leads to:",
    "High confidentiality loss",
    "Moderate integrity damage (e.g., tampered training artifacts)",
    "Temporary availability degradation (resource-heavy jobs)"
  ],
  "detection_guidance": "Defenders can monitor for:\n\n- Unusual access to tool endpoints (repeated queries, abnormal IPs/geos)  \n- Requests probing model or API capabilities or structured to elicit metadata  \n- High-frequency, low-volume activity across multiple tools  \n- Unexpected sequences of tool invocations  \n- Anomalous outbound connections after tool usage  \n- Authentication anomalies (stolen/unusual API keys, unauthorized manifest access)  \n\n**Monitoring strategies:** centralize logging, correlate user/IP patterns, alert on high-volume or suspicious sequences, apply rate limiting and anomaly detection.  \n\n---",
